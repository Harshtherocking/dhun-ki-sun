2\.**Abstract:**  
This paper explores the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for generating music from **MIDI** data, focusing on classical piano compositions by **Claude Debussy**. The proposed system processes MIDI files, encodes musical events into sequences, and trains an LSTM model to predict notes and their durations. The model generates new melodies by sampling notes autoregressively, capturing the intricate patterns and styles of the training data. The study evaluates both the **quantitative performance** (using metrics like loss) and **qualitative performance** (via human listening tests) of the generated music.

The paper presents a **data-driven** approach to music generation using **LSTM networks**. The methodology involves preprocessing MIDI files, encoding musical notes into numerical representations, and training an LSTM model over **200 epochs**. At generation time, the model is seeded with a priming sequence and iteratively predicts the next note and duration. Evaluation through **objective metrics** (e.g., loss function) and **subjective assessments** (human listeners) shows that the model can capture **long-range dependencies** and produce **coherent, aesthetically pleasing melodies**. The research highlights the promise of **deep learning** for creative music generation and suggests future directions like **multi-track** and **real-time composition** enhancements.

**3.Tools required:**

1. **Music21**: A Python toolkit for music analysis and manipulation, used for extracting and processing MIDI data.  
2. **Keras**: A high-level deep learning library for building and training the LSTM model.  
3. **LilyPond**: A music engraving tool used to render generated musical notes into human-readable sheet music.  
4. **MIDI Dataset**: Classical piano compositions, primarily by **Claude Debussy**, used for model training.
